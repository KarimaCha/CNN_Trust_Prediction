<h2>Project Description</h2>

<h4>Who Do We Trust?  Predicting Social Perceptions from Facial Images</h4>

Human judgments of trustworthiness from facial appearance strongly influence social decision-making in various fields, ranging from consumer behavior over employee & partner selection to political elections and jury decisions. 

This project aims to predict trustworthiness and other social perceptions from human faces using different machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The models are trained on the *10k US Adult Face Dataset* (http://www.wilmabainbridge.com/facememorability2.html), which contains 2222 human face images along with human ratings of trustworthiness and other social attributes. 

Best preditive performance is achieved by a CNN based on the Resnet50 architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and pre-trained on facial images (https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface). This model yields a correlation of 80% between true and predicted ratings of trustworthiness, and 66-88% correlation for other social attributes like friendliness, sociability, attractiveness, emotionality and intelligence. Furthermore, a deconvolutional approach is taken to visualize facial features contributing to the perception of these social attributes.
